# Password Generator:

# Description:
My task was to refactor this website in order to make this password generator work. I was able get this password generator functioning by creating a series of prompts and variables.  For each true prompt, I decided to use concatenation.  This made a string that I could work with.  Then, I used a "for" loop that would take characters out of my array to make a random password that got returned to the screen.
